## SS-GANs:Text-to-Image via Stage by Stage Generative Adversarial Networks (Published in PRCV2019)
We propose a novel structure of network named SS-GANs, in which specific modules are added in different stages to satisfy the unique requirements. In addition, we also explore an effective training way named coordinated train and a simple negative sample selection mechanism.
