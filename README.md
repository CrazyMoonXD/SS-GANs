Abstractï¼š<br>
we propose a novel structure of network named SS-GANs, in which specific modules are added in different stages to satisfy the unique requirements. In addition, we also explore an effective training way named coordinated train and a simple negative sample selection mechanism. Lastly, we train our model on Oxford-102 dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art models.
